        <p>My name is Verica Karanakova, and I was born on December 24, 2001, in Macedonia. My family immigrated to the United States when I was just three years old. While Macedonian was my first language and English was my second, I am fully fluent in both. I was raised in a Chicago suburb called Downers Grove. Growing up, I did rhythmic gymnastics but then switched over to dance in middle school. In high school, I was on the dance team and eventually joined the Orchesis Dance Company. I was in eighth grade when I discovered computer science and how much I enjoyed it. That was also when I decided I wanted to do something in the cs field when I grew up. Throughout high school, I took two mobile app development classes and AP Computer Science. I chose to continue my education in computer science at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I love the city of Chicago, and being able to continue studying cs in Chicago feels fulfilling. Aside from dance and coding, I enjoy listening to EDM, shopping, and traveling around the world!</p>
